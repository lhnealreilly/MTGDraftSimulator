# MTGDraftSimulator
Magic the Gathering Draft Simulation Website

This MTG drafting simulator provides a chaotic random draft experience using slightly weighted random searches from the Scryfall API.

## This Project has been merged into another project my roomate owns but here is the overview:

### Features:
- User Creation
- Table System To Host Isolated Games of Players
- Use the Scryfall REST API to fetch card information
- Draft a deck of cards
- Build a deck from the drafted cards
- Play a game in real time! (Still a work in progress)
